The "Guess the Number" game where the computer generates a random number between 0 and 100 is a simple and popular game. Here's how it works:

1)Setup: The computer selects a random number between 0 and 100 as the secret number.

2)Guessing: The player (you) start making guesses to figure out the secret number. After each guess, the computer provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

3)Feedback: Based on the feedback, you refine your subsequent guesses. If the computer tells you that your guess is too high, you might try a lower number in the next attempt, and if it says your guess is too low, you might try a higher number.

4)Winning: The game continues until you either guess the correct number or use up all your allowed attempts. If you manage to guess the correct number, you win!
